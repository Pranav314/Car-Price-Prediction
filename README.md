# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices. This project leverages various regression models to accurately estimate the selling price of used cars based on their features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust car price prediction model. This involves:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering car data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the dataset for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand relationships between features and the target variable (selling price).
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training different regression models, including Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained models using metrics such as R-squared error and visualizing actual vs. predicted prices.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pranav314/car-price-prediction.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd car-price-prediction
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook / Python script** to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is typically sourced from online car marketplaces or publicly available datasets containing information such as:
- Car Name
- Year of Manufacture
- Selling Price
- Present Price
- Kms Driven
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission Type
- Owner

## Results

The project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression and Lasso Regression in predicting car prices, providing insights into their performance and accuracy. Visualizations are included to show the correlation between actual and predicted prices.
